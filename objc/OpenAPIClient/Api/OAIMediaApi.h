/// Rescale an image to a specific width and height. The image will be resized to fit the specified width and height while maintaining the original aspect ratio unless the crop parameter is set to true. The image will be returned in the same format as the original image.

/// @param url The url of the image to be rescaled.
/// @param width The desired width of the rescaled image.

If this parameter is false, the image will keep its ratio but will be resized to fill the given box. Some content might be outside the box though.
