/// Search Books

/// @param oclc Only the book matching the OCLC will be returned (optional)
/// @param sort The sorting criteria (publish-date or rating). (optional)
/// @param sortDirection Whether to sort ascending or descending (ASC or DESC). (optional)
/// @param groupResults Whether to group similar editions of the same book. (optional)
