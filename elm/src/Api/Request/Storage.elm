{-| Read a value from the key-value store. The key-value store is a simple storage system that allows you to store and retrieve data using a key. The data is stored in the cloud and can be accessed from anywhere. You can use the key-value store to store any type of data, such as text or numbers. The key-value store is a great way to store data that you want to access from multiple devices or locations.
