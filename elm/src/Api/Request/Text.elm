{-| Extract dates from a given text. The API will return a list of dates with their positions in the text and the normalized form of the date. A large list of date formats is supported. For example, the text could contain dates in the form of \"April 5th, 2035\", \"04/05/2035\", or \"05.04.2035\". The normalized date is the date in the form of a timestamp (milliseconds since 1970).

{-| Extract entities from a text. An entity is a word or a group of words that represent a concept. For example, the word \"Canada\" represents the concept of a country. The word \"Jim Carrey\" represents the concept of a person. The word \"Tesla\" represents the concept of a company. The API will return a list of entities found in the text. The entities are classified into different types such as person, location, organization, etc.
