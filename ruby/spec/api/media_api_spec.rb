  # unit tests for rescale_image
  # Rescale Image
  # Rescale an image to a specific width and height. The image will be resized to fit the specified width and height while maintaining the original aspect ratio unless the crop parameter is set to true. The image will be returned in the same format as the original image.
  # @param url The url of the image to be rescaled.
  # @param width The desired width of the rescaled image.
  # @param height The desired height of the rescaled image.
  # @param crop Whether the image should be cropped. If true, the returned image will have exactly the given width and height and some content might have been cropped from the left/right or top/bottom. If this parameter is false, the image will keep its ratio but will be resized to fill the given box. Some content might be outside the box though.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @return [Object]

  # @param query The search query.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :number The number of images to return in range [1,10]
