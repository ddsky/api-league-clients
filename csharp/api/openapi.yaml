                      text: "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed new details about the\
                        \ upcoming Cybertruck electric pickup truck, the mass production\
                        \ of which was delayed until 2023 because of the lack of components\
                        \ and a lot of complex technologies that need to be scaled\
                        \ up. According to Musk, the initial production of the electric\
                        \ pickup truck will begin with a four-motor variant with “\
                        independent, ultra fast response torque control of each wheel,”\
                        \ the tweet reads. In response, Twitter users asked if the\
                        \ Cybertruck could turn like a tank. Musk said that thanks\
                        \ to both the rear and front wheel steer, the electric truck\
                        \ will not only be able to turn like a tank, but also drive\
                        \ diagonally like a crab. According to Electrek, this change\
                        \ could be Tesla's reaction to what its competitors do. Since\
                        \ the introduction of Tesla’s novelty, the market for electric\
                        \ pickup trucks has significantly evolved. Currently, one\
                        \ electric pickup on the market can turn like a tank – the\
                        \ Rivian R1T, while GMC's Hummer EV can drive diagonally.\
                        \ Following the announcement of Tesla Cybertruck in 2019,\
                        \ the company announced three configurations of the pickup\
                        \ truck: the entry-level model with one motor, the one with\
                        \ two motors, and the one with three. Rumor has it that the\
                        \ company intends to abandon the single-motor version altogether.\
                        \ In this case, Tesla Cybertruck will be sold with two, three,\
                        \ and four motors. Musk has promised to provide an update\
                        \ on the pickup's roadmap on the next earnings call. The production\
                        \ of Tesla Cybertruck is expected to begin at the end of 2022,\
                        \ and its mass production is slated to start in 2023."

                      by feds — and GOP lawmakers demand answers
                    text: "A Somali terrorist was allowed into the country and was\
                      \ able to operate freely for almost a year before authorities\
                      \ realized their error and rearrested him. Republican lawmakers\
                      \ are demanding information from Homeland Security Secretary\
                      \ Alejandro Mayorkas about what happened to the man — and whether\
                      \ US citizens funded any part of his journey to or stay in the\
                      \ US. The 27-year-old Somalian — who so far has not been identified\
                      \ by name — was on the watchlist as “a confirmed member of al\
                      \ Shabaab” involved in the use, manufacture or transportation\
                      \ of explosives or firearms, but a border bungle meant he was\
                      \ released after initially being arrested for crossing into\
                      \ the country illegally in California in March 2023. A letter\
                      \ from Republican lawmakers seeks to find the al-Shabaab member’\
                      s path from illegally crossing the border to Minnesota, were\
                      \ he was eventually rearrested in January, and whether he received\
                      \ any government benefits. It also seeks to find if he took\
                      \ a commercial flight with US citizens to reach their state\
                      \ and if his travel was funded with taxpayer dollars, according\
                      \ to the Tuesday letter, first obtained by The Post. The letter\
                      \ states: “Due to Minnesota’s far distance from the border,\
                      \ it is not an easy task for migrants to travel to the state\
                      \ … “Did the al-Shabbab terrorist travel to Minnesota with the\
                      \ assistance, either direct or indirect of an [Non-Governmental\
                      \ Organization]? If so, which NGO was responsible for transporting\
                      \ the individual to Minnesota?” The terrorist organization member\
                      \ had initially crossed into California and been arrested by\
                      \ the Border Patrol. However, the Terrorist Screening Center\
                      \ determined he was a “mismatch” to the terror watchlist, leading\
                      \ to his release. Nearly a year later, Immigration and Customs\
                      \ Enforcement (ICE) nabbed him after federal authorities made\
                      \ a “redetermination” and realized he was associated with the\
                      \ Somalian militant group. Al-Shabaab was formed as the militant\
                      \ wing of the Somali Council of Islamic Courts, which controlled\
                      \ the southern part of the country in late 2006. Its rule was\
                      \ defeated in 2007, according to the Office of the Director\
                      \ of National Intelligence, but it has since operated as an\
                      \ underground network and is involved in wars in and around\
                      \ Somalia. It was designated a terrorist organization in 2008\
                      \ by the US government and is notorious for carrying out bombings\
                      \ and suicide attacks. In 2013, al-Shabaab was responsible for\
                      \ a massacre at the Westgate mall in Kenya, killing 67 individuals.\
                      \ US forces have conducted six strikes in Somalia against al-Shabaab\
                      \ already this year, killing two dozen militants in the latest\
                      \ actions, according to CNN. In a February press conference,\
                      \ ICE Acting Director Patrick Lechleitner said his agency arrested\
                      \ the individual “within 48 hours” of learning his true identity.\
                      \ “The Biden administration’s open-borders agenda allowed a\
                      \ known terrorist to roam freely throughout our state, and now\
                      \ they must answer for their inexcusable negligence,” House\
                      \ Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said in a statement to The\
                      \ Post regarding the probe. The Border Patrol has recorded an\
                      \ ever-growing number of migrants listed on the terror watchlist\
                      \ attempting to enter the US illegally in recent years. Between\
                      \ October 2023 and February, agents have already recorded 70\
                      \ encounters at both the southern and northern borders, according\
                      \ to federal data. There were 172 such encounters recorded in\
                      \ fiscal year 2023, which ran from October 2022 to September\
                      \ 2023, 98 in fiscal year 2022, 16 in fiscal year 2021 and 14\
                      \ between fiscal years 2017 and 2020. In March, Border Patrol\
                      \ agents apprehended Lebanese national Basel Bassel Ebbadi,\
                      \ 22, who told personnel that he came to the US “to try to make\
                      \ a bomb,” according to internal federal documents first obtained\
                      \ by The Post. Ebbadi admitted to a border agent that he is\
                      \ a member of Hezbollah and was later confirmed as a “positive\
                      \ match” on the terror watchlist."

                    - joke: "A retiring farmer in preparation for selling his land,\
                        \ needed to rid his farm of animals. So he went to every house\
                        \ in his town. \nTo the houses where the man is the boss,\
                        \ he gave a horse. To the houses where the woman is the boss,\
                        \ a chicken was given. \nHe got toward the end of the street\
                        \ and saw a couple outside gardening. \"Who's the boss around\
                        \ here?\" he asked. \n\"I am.\" said the man. \n\"I have a\
                        \ black horse and a brown horse,\" the farmer said, \"which\
                        \ one would you like?\" \nThe man thought for a minute and\
                        \ said, \"The black one.\" \n\"No, no, no, get the brown one.\"\
                        \ the man's wife said. \n\"Here's your chicken.\" said the\
                        \ farmer."
                    - joke: "A blonde decides to try horseback riding, even though\
                        \ she has had no\r\nlessons or prior experience. She mounts\
                        \ the horse unassisted and then\r\nhorse immediately springs\
                        \ into motion. It gallops along at a steady and\r\nrhythmic\
                        \ pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the\r\nsaddle.\
                        \ In terror, she grabs for the horse's mane, but cannot seem\
                        \ to get\r\na firm grip.\r\nShe tries to throw her arms around\
                        \ the horse's neck, but she slides down\r\nthe side of the\
                        \ horse anyway. The horse gallops along, seemingly\r\nimpervious\
                        \ to its slipping rider. Finally, giving up her frail grip,\
                        \ she\r\nleaps away from the horse to try and throw herself\
                        \ to safety.\r\nUnfortunately, her foot has become entangled\
                        \ in the stirrup and she is now\r\nat the mercy of the horse's\
                        \ pounding hooves as her head is battered\r\nagainst the ground\
                        \ again and again. She is mere moments away from\r\nunconsciousness\
                        \ when...\r\n ...the Wal-Mart manager runs out to shut the\
                        \ horse off."
                    - joke: "Once Chuck Norris met a man on a horse that he did'nt\
                        \ like, now we know him as the headless horseman."

                      description: "The Vodka Fizz has a unique and intriguing taste\
                        \ profile. The vodka provides a robust and slightly sharp\
                        \ alcohol base, while the half-and-half introduces a creamy\
                        \ and smooth texture. The limeade adds a refreshing tangy\
                        \ sweetness with a citrusy zest, balancing the richness of\
                        \ the cream. The ice dilutes and chills the drink, making\
                        \ it more refreshing, and the nutmeg adds a subtle spiciness\
                        \ and aromatic warmth. Overall, this cocktail is a blend of\
                        \ creamy, tangy, slightly sweet, and mildly spicy flavors.\
                        \ If you enjoy complex drinks with a combination of creamy\
                        \ and citrusy notes, this cocktail might be a delightful choice."

                      Deeply and long the sap must flow
                      Ere the merest layer of elm can grow.

                      Many a wave's recurrent shock
                      Is needed to smooth the tiniest rock.

                      Thousands of leaves must fade and fall
                      To make the mold by the garden wall.

                      Thus, as the patient seasons roll,
                      Slowly is fashioned a human soul.

                      Purpose and failure and purpose still,
                      Steadily moved by a quiet will,—

                      Layer on layer in sturdy way,
                      Hardly seen the growth of a day,—

                      Times of failure and fear and fall,
                      But one strong tendency through it all,—

                      God and purpose and sun by sun
                      Reach the stars before they are done!
                      For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future

                      \ of medieval armament. This sword features a long, tapered\
                      \ blade, designed for both cutting and thrusting, a hallmark\
                      \ of the period's martial needs. The blade is wide at the hilt\
                      \ and narrows sharply towards the tip, indicating a focus on\
                      \ agility and precision in combat. \n\nThe hilt is adorned with\
                      \ a distinctive crossguard that provides both defense and grip\
                      \ stability, crucial in the heat of battle. The grip is wrapped\
                      \ in dark leather, likely to ensure a strong hold, while the\
                      \ pommel, often an intricate element in knightly swords, features\
                      \ decorative detailing that may signify the sword's origin or\
                      \ the status of its owner. \n\nHistorically, this sword reflects\
                      \ the transition in European warfare and chivalric culture during\
                      \ the late Middle Ages, where such weaponry symbolized not only\
                      \ martial prowess but also nobility and honor in combat. It\
                      \ stands as a testament to the craftsmanship of the era, merging\
                      \ functionality with artistry, and provides insights into the\

                      \ time."
