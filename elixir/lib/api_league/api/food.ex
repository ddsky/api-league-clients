  Compute Nutrition API
  Compute detailed nutritional information for a given recipe (list of ingredients). The API will return the nutritional information for each ingredient, as well as the total nutritional content for the entire recipe. Aside from macro and micro nutrients, the API also returns flavanoid information and food properties such as glycemic index, glycemic load, and inflammation score.

  ### Parameters

  - `connection` (APILeague.Connection): Connection to server
  - `ingredients` (String.t): A comma-separated list of the ingredients of the recipe.
  - `opts` (keyword): Optional parameters
    - `:servings` (integer()): The number of servings the ingredients make. Nutrition is computed per serving.
    - `:"reduce-oils"` (boolean()): If there is oil in the ingredients, e.g. 3 tablespoons olive oil but they are used for frying, not all of the oil is consumed and therefore should not be added to the computed nutrition. In this case set reduce-oils to true.

  ### Returns

  - `{:ok, APILeague.Model.ComputeNutritionApi200Response.t}` on success
  - `{:error, Tesla.Env.t}` on failure
